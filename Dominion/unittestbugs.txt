Bugs I found during testing:

Output from unittest1 is incorrect.
The game is supposed to be over if there are no cards in the deck.
I did not add any cards to the pile, since I never called the drawCard function.
Therefore the game should be over.
This indicates a possible issue with the initializeGame function.


Output from unittest2 is incorrect.
I added a card to the deck by setting handCount to 1.
The numHandCards function is supposed to return the number of cards in hand.
It should be 1 in this case.
This indicates a possible issue with the initializeGame function.

Output from cardtest1 is incorrect.
The great hall function is supposed to add 1 action to numActions.
This assertion failed, however.
This indicates a likely issue with the hallfunc function and a possible issue 
with the initializeGame function

Output from cardtest4 is incorrect.
The baron card is supposed to add 1 to the number of buys.
This failed the assertion in this case.
This indicates possible issues with the baron card implementation and the initializeGame function.
