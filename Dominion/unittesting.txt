After testing out the program with 4 card test functions and 4 dominion functionality,
I found the following results for each unit test:

Here, it can be seen that cardtest1 was my test case with the largest coverage, and 
it was the test for the great hall function. it had a coverage of 5.54%. The test with
the least coverage was unittest4, which was for getCost. This had a coverage of .71%, 
but I only tested it out on 2 cards. For all of the functions that I tested, my tests 
did not uncover any bugs. One bug was uncovered in my tests during testing, and this was
that the handCount variable in the state structure was not properly initialized. I got an overall 
coverage of 13.57% My tests ws able to effectively test out the core functionality of the functions chosen,
but the functions that I chose were not very large, as they were mostly between 10 and 
15 lines of code. Also, I only wrote 8 test cases total. The implications here are that 
the test were good, but I need to either add more tests in the future or test larger functions.
